In a zoo management system, there is a need to model different types of animals, including
birds and aquatic animals. Each animal has basic information such as name, species, and
age. Birds have additional attributes like wingspan and wing color. while aquatic animals
have attributes like fin length, and bone type (light or spongy). All animals can eat, Birds can
fly, and build a nest, and aquatic animals can swim. So, there is a need to model the concepts
of fly ability and float ability for certain animals.
Task 1: Implement a class hierarchy for animals ensuring proper encapsulation concepts.
Task 2: Aquatic animals could be Fish, Whale or Seal. Some of these animals live in salty
water while others live in fresh water. Some eat zooplankton while others eat other animals.
Extend the previous hierarchy to support these relations.
